# Rule 144
TLDR (formalize this into a styleized stop section):

Rule 144 is a rule that applies to every stock, public or private. When selling shares without a formal IPO or shelf offering [link these under S-forms], Rule 144 presents the easiest path for otherwise centralized and secret shares to wind up in your wallet as an investor. It's perhaps the most important tool in our effort to [decentralize capitalism](https://www.decentralizingcapitalism.com/) ðŸš€
