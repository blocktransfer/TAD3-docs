# Lifecycle of a Stock

Understanding the lifecycle of a stock is essential for grasping the complex infrastructure of the stock market. From its initial issuance to various corporate actions, each stage plays a critical role in the overall ecosystem. This guide will explore the primary issuance of stocks, secondary trading activities, and the various corporate actions that can affect a stock's journey.

## Primary Issuance

### Underwritten IPO
An underwritten Initial Public Offering (IPO) involves investment banks underwriting the shares, setting the initial price, and selling them to the public. This process helps companies raise capital and transition from private to public ownership.

### Direct Listing
In a direct listing, a company sells its existing shares directly to the public without underwriters. This can occur through initial registration, shelf statements, or insider deals, providing an alternative to the traditional IPO process.

### Private Placements
Private placements involve selling securities to a select group of investors rather than the general public. This method is not limited to private companies and can provide flexibility in raising capital.


## Secondary Trading

### Ownership Snapshots
Ownership snapshots are essential for maintaining accurate records of dividend distributions and voting rights. These snapshots ensure that shareholder entitlements are correctly allocated.

### Trade Matching
Trade matching is the process of pairing buy and sell orders in the market, traditionally managed by intermediaries. This is a central aspect of market regulations and ensures efficient and fair trading.

### Disclosures
Regular disclosures are required to maintain transparency and inform investors about the company’s performance and other relevant information. These disclosures play a vital role in the secondary market.


## Corporate Actions (todo: slightly more on vote implication on managemt performance, foorntoe with studies.)
Corporate actions are critical events initiated by companies that influence their stock and shareholder value. Companies strive for dividends to reward shareholders, strategic actions to execute their business plans, and opportunities for growth through corporate maneuvers. These actions not only shape the trajectory of the company but also impact investor perceptions and market dynamics, underscoring the dynamic nature of corporate governance and strategy.

### Rights Offerings
Rights offerings give existing shareholders the opportunity to purchase additional shares at a discounted price. This is often used to raise additional capital while giving current investors a benefit.

### Stock Splits
Stock splits involve dividing existing shares into multiple new shares, thereby reducing the price per share and increasing liquidity. Reverse splits are also possible, consolidating shares to increase the share price.

### Mergers and Acquisitions
Mergers and acquisitions involve the combination of two companies or the purchase of one company by another. These actions can significantly impact the stock’s value and shareholder equity, marking a crucial phase in the stock lifecycle.
