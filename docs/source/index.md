# Welcome to TAD3

## TAD3 is not DTCC

The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation has a long-standing history in the financial markets, providing centralized clearing and settlement for the U.S. securities market. Historically, DTCC has facilitated the efficient transfer of securities, but this centralized model has also led to inefficiencies and control by a few powerful institutions. In the late 90's, it is my understanding that DTCC management---upon increased control from brokers rather than banks---started focusing [more on profits than accuracy](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gamestop-first-successful-short-squeeze-john-wooten-xvyne/).

Accordingly, Block Transfer built TAD3, a replacement system as the [first non-DTCC Direct Registration System](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-15-23/s71523-301019-767522.pdf).

## What is Direct Registration or a DRS?
As highlighted by [WhyDRS.org](https://www.whydrs.org/), introduced a significant shift towards decentralization and direct registration of securities, emphasizing the importance of transparency and investor control.
