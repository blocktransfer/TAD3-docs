`extends TAR1`

thinkign this could be a decent place to migrate the existing work here into

will look around some more, but generally thinking [aslong these lines](https://github.com/WhyDRS/DAO-docs/issues/12#issuecomment-2373467466)

a lot of other internal things to transfer, blog post is req theret

org/t:
§144 - Transfer of restricted securities by non-affiliates without consideration

## framing:

Every ATS today has payment for order flow. But (with explicit href to https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/sdex/liquidity-on-stellar-sdex-liquidity-pools)



13 Pages Long
Incproprate stellar docs footnotes and refernces to Franklin Templeton filings and disclosures ... 



Check if there’s anyu kind of transfer agent letter on this --------
All the diction needs to be worded around classifying the investor as an underwriter
Shares aquired from an issuer are restricted and require reliance on 144 
What about shares received in good faith from a non-affiliate with the understanding that such shareholder has not been an affiliate for a period not less than six months in the case of a reporting issuer or one year in the case of a non-reporting issuer. (use language in c(1) here)
Check that these holding periods make sense for general investors
Then ask about tack-on provisions as stated in other letters in terms of transfer of restircted securities from one non-affiliate to anoyhte rtnon-affiliate without consideration - does the holding period for the recipient start at such date of transfer effectiveness or the date the sender aquired securities from the issuer or an affiliate therof,

Potentally implicate an understanding that such interpretation will not apply to restricted securities aquired by transfer without consideridation from non-affiliates (?) or is this implicated by the tack-on provisions (likely)

potnetial omnibus notes:


October 22, 2024
SEC director staff correspondance (sent to corpfin)
100 F St NE
Washington, DC 2222
via email#
Dear Recipient,

We would like to confirm certain staff perspectives regarding the private secondary trading of XYZ Corporation# common stock# between ABC, an insider thereto, and DEF, a private investor. ABC and DEF wish to use TAD3’s standardized communication protocols to facilitate the exchange of US$750,000# for 67,000 XYZ Corporation common shares.#


Ideally this would fall moreover under HFAC thing so they could shoot it down under that but permiss the private sale. Start with tradnfer basis if so and then transition to qualifications under 144 but questioning the third distribution prong, then move on to the manner of sale and transfer. Segway to a further discussion of market infrastrucutre, risk mitigation, and new investor access. Finalize with DEX private sales not as ATS. Number all the specific questions for interpretation under a “Request for Interpretation #1, 2, ...” similar to RFQ style with extensive background 1st.
